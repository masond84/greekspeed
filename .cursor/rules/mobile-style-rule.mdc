  Ensure that only **mobile responsiveness** updates are made. 
  Do NOT alter or override existing desktop / larger screen styles, 
  components, structures, or logic.  
  Focus only on styling improvements for mobile devices.

globs:
  - "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"   # adjust to match your project structure
  - "src/**/*.{css,scss}"        # if using CSS/SCSS modules

instructions: |
  1. Only add or modify styles that target small/mobile screens 
     (e.g., Tailwind responsive classes, media queries, or CSS rules 
     scoped to max-width breakpoints).  
  2. Do not change, remove, or refactor existing desktop/larger screen styles.  
  3. Do not modify component logic, structure, or props — only layout/styling.  
  4. Prioritize mobile layouts by:
     - Making the **Posts feature** the main focal element on dashboards.  
     - Stacking or collapsing secondary components (e.g., sidebars, widgets, info panels).  
     - Ensuring text remains readable and buttons/touch targets are finger-friendly.  
  5. Use your best judgment to rearrange or hide non-essential components on smaller screens, 
     but keep all existing functionality intact.  

# Example cursor behavior:
# - ✅ OK: Adding `sm:`/`md:` breakpoints in Tailwind, wrapping elements in flex/stack for mobile.
# - ❌ NOT OK: Changing desktop layout, deleting components, or rewriting logic.
