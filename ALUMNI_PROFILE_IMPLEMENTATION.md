# Alumni Profile System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a role-based profile system that extends user profiles with alumni-specific fields when the user role is set to "Alumni".

## Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Profile Editing
- **Active Members**: See basic profile fields (name, chapter, bio, phone, location, avatar)
- **Alumni**: See all basic fields PLUS additional alumni-specific fields:
  - Industry (dropdown with common industries)
  - Graduation Year (1950 to current year + 5)
  - Company
  - Job Title
  - Actively Hiring (checkbox)
  - Professional Summary

### 2. Dynamic Field Rendering
- Profile edit page automatically shows/hides alumni fields based on user role
- Alumni badge displayed on both view and edit pages
- Enhanced profile completion calculation for alumni profiles

### 3. Data Management
- Automatic creation of alumni records when needed
- Synchronized updates between profiles and alumni tables
- Proper error handling and validation

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
- **profiles table**: Basic user information (existing)
- **alumni table**: Extended alumni-specific data linked via `user_id`

### Key Files Modified

#### 1. Type Definitions (`types/profile.d.ts`)
```typescript
export interface ProfileFormData {
  // Basic fields
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  chapter: string;
  role?: 'Admin / Executive' | 'Active Member' | 'Alumni';
  bio?: string;
  phone?: string;
  location?: string;
  avatar_url?: string;
  
  // Alumni-specific fields
  industry?: string;
  graduation_year?: number;
  company?: string;
  job_title?: string;
  is_actively_hiring?: boolean;
  description?: string;
}

export interface AlumniData {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  industry: string | null;
  graduation_year: number | null;
  company: string | null;
  job_title: string | null;
  is_actively_hiring: boolean;
  description: string | null;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

#### 2. Profile Service (`lib/services/profileService.ts`)
- `getCurrentProfileWithAlumni()`: Fetches profile + alumni data
- `ensureAlumniRecord()`: Creates alumni record if missing
- `updateProfileWithAlumni()`: Updates both profile and alumni data
- `calculateAlumniCompletion()`: Enhanced completion calculation

#### 3. Profile Hook (`lib/hooks/useProfile.ts`)
- Manages both profile and alumni state
- Provides methods for updating profile with alumni data
- Handles alumni record creation

#### 4. Edit Profile Page (`app/dashboard/profile/edit/page.tsx`)
- Conditional rendering of alumni fields
- Role-based form sections
- Industry dropdown with common options
- Dynamic graduation year range
- Professional summary field

#### 5. View Profile Page (`app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`)
- Displays alumni information section
- Enhanced completion banner
- Alumni badge indicator

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the SQL script to ensure alumni records exist:
```sql
-- Execute ALUMNI_USER_ID_MIGRATION.sql in your Supabase SQL editor
```

### 2. Verify Implementation
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/profile/edit` as an alumni user
2. Verify alumni fields are visible
3. Fill out alumni information
4. Save and verify data persists
5. Check view profile page shows alumni information

### 3. Test Role Switching
- Alumni users should see extended fields
- Active members should see basic fields only
- Role changes are not allowed (as requested)

## Industry Options
The system includes a curated list of common industries:
- Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Education
- Manufacturing, Consulting, Real Estate, Marketing
- Legal, Non-Profit, Government, Retail
- Entertainment, Sports, Other

## Graduation Year Range
- **Start**: 1950
- **End**: Current year + 5 years
- Dynamic calculation ensures future graduates can be accommodated

## Profile Completion
- **Basic Profiles**: 8 fields (name, email, chapter, role, bio, phone, location, avatar)
- **Alumni Profiles**: 14 fields (basic + industry, graduation year, company, job title, actively hiring, description)
- Boolean fields (like `is_actively_hiring`) are always considered complete

## Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when alumni data is missing
- Automatic alumni record creation
- Proper error messages for failed operations
- Type-safe data handling

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Basic Functionality
- [ ] Profile loads without errors
- [ ] Alumni fields display for alumni users
- [ ] Basic fields display for all users
- [ ] Form submission works correctly
- [ ] Data persists after save

### ✅ Role-Based Rendering
- [ ] Alumni users see extended fields
- [ ] Active members see basic fields only
- [ ] Role badge displays correctly
- [ ] Completion percentage calculates correctly

### ✅ Data Validation
- [ ] Required fields are enforced
- [ ] Optional fields are properly handled
- [ ] Form validation works
- [ ] Error messages display correctly

### ✅ Database Operations
- [ ] Alumni records are created automatically
- [ ] Updates sync between tables

## Future Enhancements
1. **Industry Management**: Admin interface for managing industry options
2. **Graduation Year Validation**: More sophisticated year range logic
3. **Profile Templates**: Different field sets for different alumni types
4. **Data Export**: CSV/PDF export of alumni profiles
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Search and filter alumni by various criteria

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Alumni fields not showing**: Check user role is set to "Alumni"
2. **Data not saving**: Verify alumni record exists in database
3. **Type errors**: Ensure all imports are correct
4. **Build failures**: Check TypeScript compilation

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database connections
3. Check user authentication status
4. Validate form data structure

## Performance Considerations
- Alumni data is fetched only when needed
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management
- Optimized form handling

## Security Notes
- Role-based access control enforced
- User can only edit their own profile
- Alumni data properly isolated
- Input validation and sanitization
